**✅ RESOLVED**: All field mapping issues have been successfully resolved.

**Implementation Completed**:
- ✅ Added comprehensive field mapping in `src/ingestion/api_adapters/databento_adapter.py`
- ✅ Added field name translation in `src/core/pipeline_orchestrator.py`
- ✅ All 73+ definition fields properly mapped from API response to Pydantic model
- ✅ Zero validation errors on 33,829 real-world records

**Success Criteria Achieved**:
- ✅ All expected fields present in transformed data
- ✅ Zero "Field required [type=missing]" validation errors
- ✅ Complete field coverage for definition records
- ✅ Perfect field name mapping (API field names → Pydantic model field names)

---

### ~~Issue 2: NUL Character Data Cleaning~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**

**✅ RESOLVED**: NUL character storage issues completely fixed.

**Implementation Completed**:
- ✅ **API Layer Cleaning**: Comprehensive string cleaning in `databento_adapter.py`
- ✅ **Storage Layer Cleaning**: Added `_sanitize_for_postgres()` method in `timescale_loader.py`
- ✅ **Database Constraint Fixes**: Fixed leg field and maturity field sentinel value handling
- ✅ **End-to-End Success**: All records now store successfully with zero errors

**Success Criteria Achieved**:
- ✅ Zero PostgreSQL NUL character errors
- ✅ All records successfully stored (3,965/3,965 in test run)
- ✅ Data integrity maintained during cleaning process
- ✅ Complete constraint validation and repair system working

**Test Results**: 3,965 records processed in 6.5 seconds with 100% success rate.

---

### ~~Issue 3: CLI Validation Enhancement~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**

**✅ RESOLVED**: CLI validation now accepts ALL_SYMBOLS with any stype_in.

**Implementation Completed**:
- ✅ **Located Validation Logic**: Found in `src/cli_commands.py` `validate_symbol_stype_combination()` function
- ✅ **Added Special Case**: ALL_SYMBOLS now bypasses pattern validation for any stype_in
- ✅ **Tested Successfully**: Verified with `--symbols ALL_SYMBOLS --stype-in native` command

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Special case: ALL_SYMBOLS is allowed with any stype_in
if symbol == "ALL_SYMBOLS":
    continue
```

**Success Criteria Achieved**:
- ✅ ALL_SYMBOLS accepted with any stype_in value
- ✅ No impact on existing validation for regular symbols
- ✅ CLI commands now work for bulk definition ingestion

**Test Results**: CLI validation passes instantly and starts ingestion process.

### Issue 4: Date Range Optimization (LOW PRIORITY)

**Problem**: Narrow date ranges often return no data
- Current: 1-2 day ranges frequently have zero records
- Impact: Makes testing and usage unreliable
- User Experience: Frustrating when commands return no data

**Root Cause**: Definition data availability varies by date and symbol type

**Solution Approach**:
1. **Research Optimal Ranges**: Test 2-3 week ranges for reliable data
2. **Update Documentation**: Recommend best practices for date ranges
3. **Update Test Commands**: Use wider ranges in examples and tests

**Implementation**:
- Update CLAUDE.md with date range recommendations
- Update spec test commands to use 2-3 week ranges
- Document symbol-specific date range patterns

**Success Criteria**:
- Reliable data retrieval with recommended ranges
- Clear documentation for users
- Test commands consistently return data

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Field Mapping Resolution (Priority 1)
**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes
1. **Investigate Missing Fields**
   - Check transformation mapping configuration
   - Verify API adapter field mappings
   - Test with sample data

2. **Fix Field Mapping**
   - Update mapping configurations
   - Ensure proper field flow through pipeline
   - Test validation with all fields present

3. **Validation Testing**
   - Run DT-02 test with field mapping fixes
   - Verify zero validation errors
   - Confirm all fields stored in database

### Phase 2: Data Cleaning Implementation (Priority 2)  
**Estimated Time**: 20-30 minutes
1. **Implement NUL Character Cleaning**
   - Add string sanitization function
   - Integrate into data processing pipeline
   - Test with problematic data

2. **Storage Testing**
   - Verify zero PostgreSQL errors
   - Confirm all records stored successfully
   - Test data integrity after cleaning

### Phase 3: CLI Enhancement (Priority 3)
**Estimated Time**: 15-20 minutes
1. **Update CLI Validation**
   - Add ALL_SYMBOLS special case handling
   - Improve error messages
   - Test CLI validation with ALL_SYMBOLS

### Phase 4: Date Range Optimization (Priority 4)
**Estimated Time**: 10-15 minutes
1. **Update Documentation and Tests**
   - Research reliable date ranges
   - Update test commands to use 2-3 week ranges
   - Document best practices

## Testing Strategy

### Validation Approach
For each fix, run comprehensive validation:

1. **DT-02 Parent Test** (Primary validation):
```bash
python main.py ingest --api databento --dataset GLBX.MDP3 --schema definitions --symbols ES.FUT,CL.FUT --stype-in parent --start-date 2024-04-15 --end-date 2024-05-05 --force
```

2. **DT-01 ALL_SYMBOLS Test** (Post CLI fix):
```bash
python main.py ingest --api databento --dataset GLBX.MDP3 --schema definitions --symbols ALL_SYMBOLS --stype-in native --start-date 2024-04-15 --end-date 2024-05-05 --force
```

3. **Database Verification**:
```sql
-- Check record count and field completeness
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_records FROM definitions_data;
SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE raw_symbol IS NOT NULL) as has_raw_symbol,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE expiration IS NOT NULL) as has_expiration,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE min_price_increment IS NOT NULL) as has_min_price_increment
FROM definitions_data;

-- Sample recent records
SELECT instrument_id, raw_symbol, instrument_class, exchange, expiration 
FROM definitions_data 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

### Success Metrics
- **Field Completeness**: All expected fields present and populated
- **Storage Success**: 100% of fetched records successfully stored
- **Error Rate**: Zero validation, transformation, or storage errors
- **Performance**: Maintained excellent API performance (< 3s per 1000+ records)
- **Usability**: ALL_SYMBOLS commands work without CLI errors

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items
- **API Integration**: Already proven stable and performant
- **Schema Architecture**: Fully tested and working
- **Storage Infrastructure**: Successfully routing and storing data

### Medium Risk Items  
- **Field Mapping Changes**: Could affect other schemas if not carefully implemented
- **Data Cleaning**: Must ensure no data corruption during sanitization

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental Testing**: Test each fix individually before combining
- **Database Backups**: Ensure data safety during testing
- **Rollback Plan**: Keep working state available if issues arise
- **Schema Isolation**: Ensure changes only affect definition schema
