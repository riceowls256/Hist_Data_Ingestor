## Completed Specifications

### `completed/CLI_USER_EXPERIENCE_ENHANCEMENT_SPEC.md`
**Status:** âœ… Complete - Production Validated  
**Date Completed:** 2025-06-17  
**Summary:** Comprehensive 6-phase CLI enhancement project that transformed the basic command-line interface into a professional-grade user experience with advanced progress tracking, real-time monitoring, and enterprise-level automation. Successfully validated with live Databento API data.

**Key Achievements:**
- Advanced progress tracking with adaptive ETA calculation
- Real-time status monitoring with persistent operation tracking
- Enhanced interactive features with smart validation
- Workflow automation with high-level commands
- Performance optimizations with 70-95% efficiency gains
- CLI configuration system with environment adaptation

**Live Validation:**
- HO.c.0 (Heating Oil): 6 records successfully ingested
- RB.FUT (RBOB Gasoline): 398 records successfully ingested
- Sub-second performance with professional error handling

### `completed/symbol-field-mapping-fix-spec.md`
**Status:** âœ… Complete - Successfully Implemented  
**Date Completed:** 2025-06-17  
**Summary:** Critical fix for symbol field mapping issues that were preventing successful trade record ingestion. Implemented robust validation and repair system that eliminated validation failures and achieved 100% ingestion success rate.

**Key Achievements:**
- Fixed critical "Field required [type=missing]" errors for symbol field
- Eliminated 315,493 validation errors
- Achieved 100% trade record ingestion success rate (3,459/3,459 records)
- Added automatic symbol field mapping and fallback logic
- Zero performance impact with comprehensive monitoring

## Active Specifications

### `active/DATA_INGESTION_COMPLETION_SPEC.md`
**Status:** ðŸ”„ Draft - Planned Implementation  
**Priority:** High  
**Summary:** Outlines remaining work to complete the data ingestion system, focusing on TBBO fixes, CLI enhancements, testing improvements, and final integration verification.

**Planned Phases:**
1. TBBO Critical Fixes - Field mapping and SQL constraint resolution
2. CLI Progress Bar Enhancement - Reduce terminal spam during operations
3. Testing & Quality Assurance - Comprehensive test coverage
4. Integration & Verification - End-to-end system validation

## Specification Lifecycle

### Status Definitions
- **ðŸ”„ Draft:** Initial specification, planning phase
- **ðŸ”„ Active:** Specification in development/implementation
- **âœ… Complete:** Specification fully implemented and validated
- **ðŸ“š Archived:** Superseded or no longer relevant specifications

### Moving Specifications
When a specification is completed:
1. Update the status in the document header
2. Add completion summary and validation results
3. Move from `active/` to `completed/` directory
4. Update this README with completion details

### Creating New Specifications
1. Create new specs in `active/` directory
2. Use consistent document structure and metadata
3. Include clear success criteria and validation methods
4. Add entry to this README under Active Specifications

## Integration with Project Documentation

These specifications are referenced throughout the project documentation:
- **CLAUDE.md:** Implementation notes and completion status
- **docs/project_summaries/:** High-level summaries and results
- **README.md:** Main project documentation with quick references

## Quality Standards

All specifications must include:
- Clear executive summary and scope
- Detailed technical requirements
- Success criteria and validation methods
- Implementation timeline and priorities
- Integration points with existing systems

**Completed specifications serve as:**
- Historical record of technical decisions
- Reference for similar future work
- Validation of successful implementation
- Documentation for maintenance and support
