## Legacy Demonstrations

### Legacy CLI Help Demo

**File:** `legacy/test_cli_help_demo.py`
**Purpose:** Early demonstration of CLI help enhancements before full implementation.

### Statistics Fix Demo

**File:** `legacy/test_statistics_fix.py`
**Purpose:** Demonstration of the statistics data ingestion fixes implemented during development.

## Running All Demonstrations

To run a comprehensive demonstration of all CLI enhancements:

```bash
# Navigate to demos directory
cd demos/cli_enhancements

# Run Phase 1 demonstrations
echo "=== Phase 1: Advanced Progress Tracking ==="
python demo_enhanced_progress.py

echo "=== Phase 1: Metrics Integration ==="
python demo_metrics_display.py

# Run Phase 5 demonstration
echo "=== Phase 5: Performance Optimizations ==="
python demo_throttled_progress.py

# Run Phase 6 demonstration
echo "=== Phase 6: Configuration System ==="
python demo_phase6_configuration.py

# Run Phase 3 demonstration
echo "=== Phase 3: Interactive Features ==="
python demo_new_help_features.py
```

## Demo Prerequisites

All demonstrations require:
- Python 3.8+ with required dependencies installed
- Rich library for terminal formatting
- Access to the main Historical Data Ingestor codebase

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r ../../requirements.txt
```

## Integration with Main CLI

These demonstrations showcase features that are fully integrated into the main CLI application. You can access these features through:

```bash
# Main CLI with enhanced features
python ../../main.py --help

# Configuration management
python ../../main.py config environment
python ../../main.py config list

# Enhanced progress (automatic in all operations)
python ../../main.py ingest --api databento --job ohlcv_1d

# Live monitoring dashboard
python ../../main.py status-dashboard

# Interactive workflows
python ../../main.py workflow create
```

## Customization and Extension

Each demonstration script can be customized to show specific features or scenarios:

1. **Modify data volumes** in progress demonstrations
2. **Adjust timing intervals** for different pacing
3. **Change configuration examples** to match your environment
4. **Add custom metrics** to metrics demonstrations
5. **Create new workflow examples** in interactive demos

## Troubleshooting

If demonstrations don't run properly:

1. **Check Python path:** Ensure the `src/` directory is in your Python path
2. **Verify dependencies:** Run `pip install -r ../../requirements.txt`
3. **Check permissions:** Ensure write access for configuration files
4. **Terminal compatibility:** Some features require color and Unicode support

For issues, check the main project documentation or run individual demonstrations with verbose output.

## Performance Notes

- Demonstrations are designed to run quickly (30 seconds to 2 minutes each)
- Some demos simulate heavy workloads but use small data sets
- Performance metrics shown are representative, not benchmarks
- Real-world performance may vary based on system capabilities

## Contributing

To add new demonstrations:

1. Create descriptive Python scripts with comprehensive comments
2. Include error handling and user-friendly output
3. Add documentation to this README
4. Ensure demonstrations work across different environments
5. Test with both development and production configurations
