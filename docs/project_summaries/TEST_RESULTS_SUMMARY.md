## Runtime Integration Testing Results

**Date Added:** 2025-06-17  
**Status:** Critical findings documented and resolved

### Live Data Integration Testing

During live data ingestion testing with real Databento API data, we discovered and resolved critical runtime integration issues:

#### Issues Discovered & Resolved
- **Missing EnhancedProgress Methods:** `update_stage()`, `set_status()`, `update_metrics()` were expected by PipelineOrchestrator but not implemented
- **Console Parameter Error:** EnhancedProgress constructor doesn't accept console parameter  
- **Test Coverage Gap:** Mocks tested interface but not real implementation

#### Successful Live Testing Results
- ✅ **HO.c.0 (Heating Oil):** 6 records ingested successfully (May 25-June 2, 2024)
- ✅ **RB.FUT (RBOB Gasoline):** 398 records ingested successfully (same period)
- ✅ **Enhanced Progress Tracking:** Working perfectly with live API data
- ✅ **Professional Error Handling:** Clear guidance for symbol format requirements
- ✅ **Performance Validated:** Sub-second ingestion and query times maintained

#### Key Learnings
- **Mock vs Reality Gap:** Need both contract tests (mocks) and integration tests (real implementations)
- **Symbol Format Requirements:** Parent symbols require `[ROOT].FUT` format, continuous use `[ROOT].c.0`
- **API Error Handling:** Enhanced user guidance for symbol format validation
- **Production Readiness:** Successfully handles real financial data volumes

#### Documentation Created
- **Complete Analysis:** See `docs/project_summaries/RUNTIME_INTEGRATION_LESSONS_LEARNED.md`
- **Test Strategy Updates:** Recommendations for dual testing approach
- **Symbol Format Guide:** Comprehensive Databento API symbol requirements
- **Development Best Practices:** Lessons for future enhancement projects
