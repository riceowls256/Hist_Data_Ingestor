# Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)

This directory contains all Product Requirements Documents for the Historical Data Ingestor project.

## Directory Structure

### `/active/`
Contains PRDs for features or initiatives that are currently in development or planning phases.

**Current Active PRDs:**
- `CLI_REFACTORING_PRD.md` - Comprehensive CLI architecture refactoring plan

### `/complete/`
Contains PRDs for features that have been fully implemented and are no longer actively being developed.

## PRD Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: New PRDs are created in `/active/` when a significant feature or architectural change is planned
2. **Active Development**: PRDs remain in `/active/` during implementation and are updated as needed
3. **Completion**: When implementation is complete and the feature is stable, PRDs are moved to `/complete/`
4. **Archive**: Completed PRDs serve as historical documentation and implementation reference

## PRD Standards

### Naming Convention
- Use descriptive names with underscores: `FEATURE_NAME_PRD.md`
- Include the word "PRD" in the filename
- Use UPPERCASE for major words

### Required Sections

- **Change Log** - Track updates and modifications

### Update Guidelines
