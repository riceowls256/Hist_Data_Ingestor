# Formal Story Review Process & Quality Gates

## Purpose

This document establishes mandatory quality gates and review checkpoints to ensure all stories meet proper sprint framework standards before being marked as complete. This prevents velocity pollution, technical debt accumulation, and stakeholder confusion.

- [ ] Velocity calculations exclude stories without proper Gate completion
- [ ] Story dependency chains validated and updated

### **Monthly Process Audit**
**Responsibility:** Scrum Master + Product Owner

- [ ] Automate checklist validation where possible
- [ ] Establish baseline velocity metrics with proper story completion

## Success Metrics

### **Process Health Indicators:**
- **Gate Compliance Rate:** >95% of stories complete all required gates
- **Review Cycle Time:** Average time between gates <2 business days
