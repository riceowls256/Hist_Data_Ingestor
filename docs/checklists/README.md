## **⚡ Quick Reference Guide**

### **When to Use Each Document:**

| Situation | Document | Time Required | Who's Involved |
|-----------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **New story created** | [Story Review Process](story-review-process.md) - Gate 1 | 15 min | Scrum Master + Product Owner |
| **Ready to start development** | [Story Review Process](story-review-process.md) - Gate 2 | 20 min | Scrum Master + Lead Dev + Stakeholder |
| **Implementation finished** | [Story Review Process](story-review-process.md) - Gate 3 | 30 min | Senior Developer + Scrum Master |
| **Claiming story complete** | [Story Review Process](story-review-process.md) - Gate 4 | 45 min | Scrum Master + Product Owner + Stakeholder |
| **Auditing existing "complete" stories** | [Story Audit Checklist](story-audit-checklist.md) | 60-90 min | Scrum Master |

### **🚨 Red Flags - Immediate Action Required:**

- ❌ **Story marked "Complete" without Gate 4 review** → Use audit checklist immediately
- ❌ **Story in "In Progress" for >2 sprints** → Schedule Gate 3 review
- ❌ **Story missing Dependencies/DoD sections** → Cannot proceed past Gate 1
- ❌ **No Product Owner acceptance documented** → Story not actually complete

### **✅ Success Indicators:**

- ✅ All 4 gates completed with documented sign-offs
- ✅ Story points estimated before development starts
- ✅ Risks identified and mitigation plans in place
- ✅ Definition of Done has 8+ specific criteria
- ✅ Product Owner formal acceptance obtained

- **90-100%:** ✅ **COMPLIANT** - Story properly complete

- **50-69%:** 🔄 **MAJOR GAPS** - Downgrade to "Implementation Complete"
- **<50%:** ❌ **NON-COMPLIANT** - Downgrade to "In Progress" or "Draft"
