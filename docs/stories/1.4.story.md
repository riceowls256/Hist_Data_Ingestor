# Story 1.4: Implement Basic Centralized Logging Framework

## Status: Review

## Story

- As a Developer
- I want a basic centralized logging framework configured for all modules
- so that application events, warnings, and errors are consistently recorded

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Logging works as specified for all modules
2. Log levels and formats are respected
3. Unit tests pass

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Create logging configuration module/function in `src/utils/custom_logger.py` (AC: 1)
  - [x] Use Python's `logging` module (optionally with `structlog` for structured output)
  - [x] Support both console and rotating file handlers
  - [x] Define standard log format (timestamp, level, module, message)
  - [x] Make log file path configurable (default: `logs/app.log`)
- [x] Ensure all modules can easily get a configured logger (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Provide a `get_logger(name)` function for module-level loggers
  - [x] Document usage in README and code docstrings
- [x] Configure log levels via config (`configs/system_config.yaml` and environment variable override) (AC: 2)
- [x] Implement log rotation (e.g., `RotatingFileHandler`, max size, backup count) (AC: 1, 2)
- [x] Add example logger usage to at least one core module (e.g., `src/core/config_manager.py`) (AC: 1)
- [x] Write unit tests for logging setup in `tests/utils/test_custom_logger.py` (AC: 3)
  - [x] Test logger creation, log level, file output, and rotation
  - [x] Test that log messages appear in both console and file as expected

## Dev Technical Guidance {detail not covered in tasks/subtasks}

- **Architecture Alignment:**
  - Logging is a cross-cutting concern; all major components (Orchestrator, API Adapters, Transformation, Validation, Storage, CLI, etc.) should use the centralized logger.
  - Place the logging setup in `src/utils/custom_logger.py` for easy import.
  - Log file output should go to `logs/app.log` (ensure `logs/` is git-ignored).
  - Use a standard log format: `[%(asctime)s] %(levelname)s %(name)s: %(message)s`.
  - For structured logging, consider integrating `structlog` (optional for MVP).
  - Log rotation: Use `RotatingFileHandler` (e.g., 5MB per file, keep 3 backups).
  - Log level should default to `INFO`, configurable via `system_config.yaml` and overridable by an environment variable (e.g., `LOG_LEVEL`).
  - All modules should obtain their logger via `get_logger(__name__)`.
  - Console logs should be human-readable; file logs can be plain or JSON if using `structlog`.
- **Testing Guidance:**
  - Unit tests should verify logger creation, log level, file output, and rotation.
  - Use temporary directories/files for log output in tests to avoid polluting real logs.
  - Test that log messages appear in both console and file as expected.
- **References:**
  - See `docs/architecture.md#LoggingModule` for architectural intent.
  - See `docs/prd.md#NFR 2` for reliability and error logging requirements.
  - See `src/core/config_manager.py` for config integration.
  - See `logs/` directory for log file output location.
- **Project Structure Notes:**
  - `src/utils/custom_logger.py` will be the single source of logging setup.
  - All modules should import and use this logger.
  - `logs/` directory must exist or be created at runtime.
  - Add `logs/` to `.gitignore` if not already present.
  - No existing logging setup found; this will be a new implementation.

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Scrum Master (Fran)`

### Completion Notes List

- Story file drafted by Scrum Master agent per granular checklist and template.
- All technical and contextual requirements synthesized from PRD, architecture, and epic.
- Centralized logging implemented in `src/utils/custom_logger.py` using `structlog` and Python's logging module.
- Console and file logging (with rotation) are working and configurable via YAML/env.
- All modules now use the centralized logger; no stray print statements remain.
- Logger usage is documented in the README and `.gitignore` excludes logs.
- Logger integration tested and verified in both console and file output.
- 2024-06-09: Story marked complete after review and verification.

## Story DoD Checklist Report

- [x] Centralized logger implemented in `src/utils/custom_logger.py`
- [x] Logger supports console and file output with rotation
- [x] Log level and format configurable via config/env
- [x] All modules use the centralized logger
- [x] Unit tests for logger creation, log level, file output, rotation, and console/file output
- [x] Tests use temporary files/directories for log output
- [x] All required tests pass
- [x] Logger usage documented in README and code docstrings
- [x] No stray print statements remain

## Summary

- Centralized logging implemented in `src/utils/custom_logger.py` using structlog and Python logging.
- Console and file logging (with rotation) are supported; log level and format are configurable via YAML/env.
- All modules use the centralized logger; no stray print statements remain.
- Logger usage is documented in README and code docstrings.
- Unit tests cover logger creation, log level, file output, rotation, and console/file output, using temp files/dirs.
- All tests pass.
- Key lesson: Ensuring the correct PYTHONPATH and import structure is critical for test discovery and logger usability across the project.
