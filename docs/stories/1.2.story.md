# Story 1.2: Implement Core Configuration Management for System Settings

**Reference:** PRD ยง6, Epic 1, Story 1.2

**Status:** Review

---

## Story Description
As a Developer,
I want a core configuration management system that can load system-level settings from `configs/system_config.yaml` and environment variables,
So that basic application parameters are centrally managed and easily accessible.

---

## Tasks
- [x] Create `ConfigManager` class in `src/core/`
- [x] Load and parse settings from `configs/system_config.yaml`
- [x] Securely access and prioritize environment variables for sensitive settings
- [x] Provide easy access to configuration values
- [x] Implement error handling for missing/malformed config
- [x] Write unit tests for loading, overrides, and error handling
- [x] Refactor to use Pydantic BaseSettings for all config classes, removing manual environment variable and type-casting logic. Environment variables now override YAML defaults automatically.

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] ConfigManager loads and validates config as specified
- [x] Unit tests pass for all config scenarios
- [x] Refactored code is simpler, more maintainable, and leverages Pydantic's features for environment overrides and type conversion.

## Operational Log & Notes

- 2024-06-08: Converted project to a modern src-layout Python package. Added setup.py, setup.cfg, and pyproject.toml in the project root. Updated config files to point to the correct src directory.
- 2024-06-08: Verified ConfigManager implementation meets requirements (YAML loading, env var overrides, error handling, Pydantic validation).
- 2024-06-08: Added/expanded unit tests for ConfigManager (YAML only, env var override, missing file, malformed config). All tests pass.
- 2024-06-08: Ran pytest; all 4 ConfigManager tests passed. Project is now ready for further development and CI integration.
- 2024-06-08: **Refactored ConfigManager to use Pydantic BaseSettings for all config classes.** Manual environment variable lookups and type-casting logic were removed. Now, YAML provides defaults and environment variables override automatically. The code is leaner, easier to maintain, and less error-prone. This change was made to reduce complexity and leverage Pydantic's strengths as intended.
