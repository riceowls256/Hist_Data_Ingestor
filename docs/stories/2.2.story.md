# Story 2.2: Implement Databento API Adapter using Python Client for Data Extraction

## Status: Complete

## Story

- As a Developer
- I want to implement a DatabentoAdapter class (e.g., in src/ingestion/api_adapters/databento_adapter.py)
- that utilizes the official databento-python client library to connect to the Databento API using the provided configuration (API key, dataset, symbols, schema, stype_in, date range), fetch historical data via timeseries.get_range(), iterate through the DBNStore to yield decoded DBN records for various schemas (OHLCV, Trades, TBBO, Statistics), and handle API-specific nuances, so that raw, structured data objects from Databento can be reliably extracted.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. DatabentoAdapter Class Created: Class in src/ingestion/api_adapters/databento_adapter.py, ideally inheriting BaseAdapter.
2. Configuration Driven: Adapter constructor uses Databento config to init databento.Historical client and determine request params for all configured schemas.
3. Data Fetching Method (workspace_historical_data): Method takes job config, calls client.timeseries.get_range(), iterates DBNStore.
4. DBN Record to Pydantic Model Conversion: Adapter converts DBN records to corresponding Pydantic models from "Databento Downloader: Detailed Specifications" or custom Pydantic models for the defined schemas.
5. Output Decoded Pydantic Records: workspace_historical_data yields/returns list of validated Databento Pydantic model instances for all requested schemas.
6. Handles Multiple Symbols & Date Chunking (as per config): Processes all symbols; implements date chunking if date_chunk_interval_days configured.
7. Basic Error Handling & Retries (Leveraging Tenacity): Adapter implements tenacity retry logic (respecting Retry-After) around client.timeseries.get_range(), using config parameters.
8. Unit Tests: Unit tests for DatabentoAdapter (mocking databento.Historical client) verify param passing, DBNStore iteration, Pydantic conversion for various schemas, error handling, and date chunking.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Create src/ingestion/api_adapters/databento_adapter.py
  - [x] Define DatabentoAdapter class (inherit BaseAdapter if present)
  - [x] Implement __init__ to load config and initialize databento.Historical client
  - [x] Implement fetch_historical_data method for data fetching (renamed from workspace_historical_data per BaseAdapter interface)
  - [x] Convert DBN records to Pydantic models for all supported schemas
  - [x] Implement date chunking and multi-symbol support
  - [x] Integrate tenacity retry logic for API calls
- [x] Write unit tests for DatabentoAdapter (mocking API client)
- [x] Document usage and configuration in code docstrings
- [x] Moved Pydantic models to src/storage/models.py for pipeline-wide reuse
- [ ] Peer review and revise as needed

## Dev Technical Guidance {detail not covered in tasks/subtasks}

- Reference the "Databento Downloader: Detailed Specifications" for Pydantic model structure and API usage.
- Use the config file from Story 2.1 for all parameters.
- Ensure robust error handling and logging (use structlog).
- Use tenacity for retries, respecting Retry-After headers.
- Mock API client in unit tests to avoid real API calls.
- Document all public methods and classes with Google-style docstrings.

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: Scrum Master (Fran), Full Stack Dev (James)

### Completion Notes List

- Story file drafted by Scrum Master agent per Epic 2 and PRD requirements.
- All technical and contextual requirements synthesized from epic2.md, PRD, and architecture.
- Dev Agent implemented DatabentoAdapter with full feature set per ACs.
- Moved Pydantic models to src/storage/models.py for better separation of concerns.

### Change Log

- 2024-06-13: Initial draft created by Scrum Master agent.
- 2024-12-19: Dev Agent started implementation - DEPENDENCY APPROVAL NEEDED: databento-python>=0.52.0 is required but not in requirements.txt. This is the official Databento Python client library, essential for connecting to Databento API as specified in tech stack and story requirements. Alternative would be implementing HTTP client from scratch, which is not recommended for production use.
- 2024-12-19: **User approved databento-python>=0.52.0 on 2024-12-19** - proceeding with implementation.
- 2024-12-19: **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED** - DatabentoAdapter fully implemented with:
  - Proper config-driven initialization using environment variable for API key
  - Complete fetch_historical_data method with date chunking support
  - Multi-symbol processing capability
  - Tenacity retry logic with configurable parameters
  - DBN record to Pydantic model conversion for all supported schemas
  - Comprehensive error handling and structured logging
  - Moved Pydantic models to src/storage/models.py for pipeline-wide reuse
- 2024-12-19: **TESTING ENVIRONMENT ISSUE IDENTIFIED** - Cannot run unit tests due to numpy/conda environment conflict. Tests are written but blocked by system-level dependency issue unrelated to our code quality.
- 2024-12-19: **ENVIRONMENT ISSUE RESOLVED** - Fixed by uninstalling and reinstalling numpy, pandas, and databento packages. All 19 unit tests now pass successfully.

## Final Verdict

This is a good blueprint. There's no fat on it. Every task serves the goal. It follows the rule: talk less, measure twice, cut once.

The only thing to keep in mind is the details of the execution. The plan correctly states that the adapter needs to convert DBN records into Pydantic models for "various schemas". The developer needs to be meticulous here and ensure that the implementation correctly handles the specific fields for all the required schemas—OHLCV, Trades, TBBO, and Statistics—as laid out in the architecture and PRD.
