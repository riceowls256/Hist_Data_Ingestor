# Story 2.1: Configure Databento API Access and Parameters

## Status: Review

## Story

- As a Developer
- I want to create an API-specific YAML configuration file for Databento (configs/api_specific/databento_config.yaml)
- so that the system can connect to and understand how to process data from Databento for all required schemas and symbols

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Databento Configuration File Created: databento_config.yaml exists in configs/api_specific/.
2. Authentication Configuration: YAML contains api section with key_env_var (e.g., DATABENTO_API_KEY).
3. Job Definition Structure: YAML includes a jobs list, each with dataset, schema (e.g., ohlcv.1s, trades, tbbo, statistics.daily_summary), symbols, start_date, end_date, stype_in, and optional date_chunk_interval_days. Supported schemas: OHLCV (1s, 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 1d), Trades, TBBO, Statistics.
4. Data Extraction Parameters: YAML includes a basic retry_policy for Databento.
5. Mapping and Validation References: YAML includes mapping_config_path (to databento_mappings.yaml) and validation_schema_paths.
6. YAML Validity and Pydantic Compatibility: databento_config.yaml is well-formed and aligns with Pydantic models from "Databento Downloader: Detailed Specifications".
7. Documentation: configs/README.md updated with Databento config example and schema documentation.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Draft initial databento_config.yaml in configs/api_specific/
  - [x] Add api section with key_env_var
  - [x] Add jobs list with all required fields and supported schemas
  - [x] Add retry_policy section
  - [x] Add mapping_config_path and validation_schema_paths
- [x] Validate YAML against Pydantic models (if available)
- [x] Update configs/README.md with example and documentation
- [ ] Peer review and revise as needed

## Dev Technical Guidance {detail not covered in tasks/subtasks}

- Reference the "Databento Downloader: Detailed Specifications" for config structure and Pydantic model compatibility.
- Use environment variable for API key (do not hardcode secrets).
- Ensure all required schemas and job parameters are covered.
- Use clear, descriptive field names and comments in YAML.
- Document the config structure and usage in configs/README.md.
- Validate YAML with Pydantic or a YAML linter before marking complete.
