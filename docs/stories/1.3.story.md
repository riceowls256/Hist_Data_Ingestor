# Story 1.3: Establish Dockerized Development Environment

**Reference:** PRD §6, Epic 1, Story 1.3

**Status:** Review

---

## Story Description
As a Developer,
I want a Dockerfile for the Python app and a docker-compose.yml for the app and TimescaleDB,
So that I can quickly and consistently set up and run the entire development environment locally.

---

## Tasks
- [x] Create Python application Dockerfile
    - [x] Use python:3.11-slim-bookworm as base image
    - [x] Install system and Python dependencies
    - [x] Set up non-root user for security
    - [x] Set workdir and entrypoint
- [x] Create docker-compose.yml
    - [x] Define app service (build from Dockerfile, mount code, expose port)
    - [x] Define TimescaleDB service (pin to 2.14.2-pg14, set env vars, mount volume)
    - [x] Add optional, commented-out pgAdmin service
- [x] Create/update .env.example
    - [x] Include all required variables for app, database, and pgAdmin
    - [x] Ensure .env is in .gitignore
- [x] Update README.md
    - [x] Add "Getting Started (Docker)" section
    - [x] Document prerequisites, configuration, running, CLI usage, stopping, and pgAdmin
- [x] Log all actions and decisions in this story file

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `docker-compose up` starts both containers without errors
- [x] App can connect to TimescaleDB
- [x] Instructions are clear in README

---

## Operational Log & Notes

- 2024-06-08: ✅ Successfully connected to TimescaleDB from the app container. All objectives for Story 1.3 are complete. Story status set to Review and ready for closure.
- 2024-06-08: Docker containers for the app and TimescaleDB start successfully via `docker-compose up`. Verified that the app container runs and displays the expected output. README.md instructions were followed and confirmed accurate. Foundational environment is up and running. Ready to proceed to database connectivity testing.
- 2024-06-08: Created Dockerfile for Python app using python:3.11-slim-bookworm, installed system and Python dependencies, set up non-root user, and defined entrypoint. Reviewed and approved.
- 2024-06-08: Created docker-compose.yml with app and TimescaleDB (pinned to 2.14.2-pg14), live-reloading volume, and optional pgAdmin service. Reviewed and approved.
- 2024-06-08: Added .env.example with all required variables for app, DB, and pgAdmin. Ensured .env is in .gitignore. Reviewed and approved.
- 2024-06-08: Updated README.md with clear Docker setup, run, CLI, and pgAdmin instructions. cp command corrected for root-level .env files. Reviewed and approved.

## Summary

Story 1.3: Establish Dockerized Development Environment

**Status:** Review (Complete, ready for closure)

### What Was Accomplished
- **Dockerfile:**
  - Created for the Python app using python:3.11-slim-bookworm.
  - Installs all system and Python dependencies.
  - Sets up a non-root user and correct entrypoint.
- **docker-compose.yml:**
  - Defines services for the app and TimescaleDB (pinned to 2.14.2-pg14).
  - Uses environment variables from a .env file.
  - Mounts code for live reload and persistent DB storage.
  - Includes an optional, commented-out pgAdmin service for DB administration.
- **.env.example:**
  - Added with all required variables for the app, TimescaleDB, and pgAdmin.
  - .env is gitignored for security.
- **README.md:**
  - Updated with a clear "Getting Started (Docker)" section.
  - Step-by-step instructions for setup, running, CLI usage, stopping, and enabling pgAdmin.
- **Testing:**
  - Verified that `docker-compose up` starts both containers without errors.
  - Confirmed the app can connect to TimescaleDB using environment variables.
  - All instructions in README.md were followed and confirmed accurate.
- **Documentation:**
  - All actions, decisions, and status updates are logged in docs/stories/1.3.story.md.
  - All tasks and acceptance criteria are checked off and complete.

### Key Outcomes
- The foundational development environment is fully Dockerized, reproducible, and secure.
- All documentation is up to date and developer-friendly.
- The environment is ready for further development, database schema creation, and data ingestion.

**Next Agent:**
You can now proceed with database schema setup, application logic, or any subsequent story, building on this robust, tested foundation.
