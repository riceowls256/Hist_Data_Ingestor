## Story

As a Developer, I want to perform end-to-end tests for the Databento data pipeline, fetching a small sample of historical data for various schemas (using the databento-python client via the adapter), processing it through transformation and validation, and verifying its correct and idempotent storage in TimescaleDB, so that the complete data flow for Databento is confirmed to be working as expected using the established framework.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

AC1: **Test Data Scope Defined (Databento):** Small, specific test dataset defined for Databento (e.g., 1-2 symbols, specific dataset/schemas like ohlcv.1m, trades, tbbo, 1-2 days data), documented.

AC2: **TimescaleLoader Reusability Confirmed:** Existing TimescaleLoader processes standardized data from Databento pipeline without Databento-specific core logic changes for all schemas.

AC3: **End-to-End Pipeline Run for Databento Test Data:** PipelineOrchestrator executes Databento pipeline for test data via CLI without unhandled errors.

AC4: **Data Correctly Stored in TimescaleDB (Databento):** Ingested, transformed, validated Databento test data for various schemas is present and correct in TimescaleDB, verified by direct query.

AC5: **Idempotency Verified (Databento):** Second run with same test data does not create duplicates or incorrectly change valid records.

AC6: **Quarantine Handling Verified (Databento - if applicable):** Sample Databento data designed to fail validation is correctly quarantined; only valid data in main table.

AC7: **Logs Confirm Successful Flow (Databento):** Logs confirm successful completion of each stage for Databento test data, or errors/quarantining.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### **Test Data Scope Definition**

**Recommended Test Dataset Parameters:**
```yaml
# Test job configuration example
test_jobs:
  e2e_small_sample:
    dataset: "GLBX.MDP3"
    symbols: ["ES.c.0", "CL.c.0"]  # ES Futures + Crude Oil for diversity
    start_date: "2024-01-15"        # 2-day window for manageable data volume
    end_date: "2024-01-16"
    schemas: ["ohlcv-1d", "trades", "tbbo", "statistics"]
    
  definition_test:
    dataset: "GLBX.MDP3"
    schema: "definition"
    start_date: "2024-01-01"
    end_date: "2024-01-31"          # Monthly definition snapshot
```

**Expected Data Volumes (based on retrospective analysis):**
- **OHLCV-1d:** ~2 records per symbol (low volume, quick validation)
- **Trades:** ~400K+ records per symbol per day (high volume stress test)
- **TBBO:** ~400K+ records per symbol per day (high volume + quote data)
- **Statistics:** ~10-20 records per symbol per month (low volume, metadata rich)
- **Definition:** ~50+ definition records per symbol (metadata validation)

### **CLI Test Execution Framework**

**Primary Test Commands:**
```bash
# Execute comprehensive end-to-end test
python main.py ingest --api databento --job e2e_small_sample --verbose

# Test specific schema types
python main.py ingest --api databento \
  --dataset GLBX.MDP3 \
  --schema ohlcv-1d \
  --symbols ES.c.0 \
  --start-date 2024-01-15 \
  --end-date 2024-01-16

# Definition schema specific test
python main.py ingest --api databento --job definition_test
```

**Test Infrastructure Pattern:**
```python
# Integration test framework
class DatabentoE2ETestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Initialize test database
        # Load test configurations
        # Set up logging capture
        
    def test_ohlcv_pipeline_execution(self):
        # Execute pipeline for OHLCV data
        # Verify database storage
        # Check idempotency
        
    def test_high_volume_trades_handling(self):
        # Test trades schema (400K+ records)
        # Verify performance and memory usage
        # Validate data integrity
        
    def tearDown(self):
        # Clean up test database
        # Archive test logs
```

### **Database Verification Queries**

**Data Integrity Verification:**
```sql
-- Verify OHLCV data integrity
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as record_count,
    MIN(ts_event) as earliest_timestamp,
    MAX(ts_event) as latest_timestamp,
    COUNT(DISTINCT instrument_id) as unique_instruments
FROM daily_ohlcv_data 
WHERE data_source = 'databento';

-- Verify business logic constraints
SELECT COUNT(*) as invalid_ohlc_records
FROM daily_ohlcv_data 
WHERE high_price < low_price 
   OR high_price < open_price 
   OR high_price < close_price;

-- Verify trades data volume and integrity
SELECT 
    instrument_id,
    DATE(ts_event) as trade_date,
    COUNT(*) as trade_count,
    MIN(price) as min_price,
    MAX(price) as max_price,
    SUM(size) as total_volume
FROM trades_data 
WHERE ts_event >= '2024-01-15' AND ts_event < '2024-01-17'
GROUP BY instrument_id, DATE(ts_event)
ORDER BY instrument_id, trade_date;
```

**Idempotency Verification:**
```sql
-- Check for duplicate records (should return 0)
SELECT 
    instrument_id, ts_event, granularity,
    COUNT(*) as duplicate_count
FROM daily_ohlcv_data 
GROUP BY instrument_id, ts_event, granularity
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Verify DownloadProgressTracker state
SELECT 
    job_id, 
    chunk_identifier,
    completion_status,
    records_processed
FROM download_progress 
WHERE job_type = 'databento_e2e_test'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### **Performance and Error Monitoring**

**Log Analysis Patterns:**
```python
# Log verification for pipeline stages
expected_log_patterns = [
    "Pipeline execution started for job: e2e_small_sample",
    "DatabentoAdapter initialized successfully",
    "Fetched \d+ records from Databento API",
    "RuleEngine transformation completed: \d+ records processed",
    "Validation completed: \d+ valid, \d+ quarantined",
    "TimescaleLoader: \d+ records stored successfully",
    "Pipeline execution completed successfully"
]

# Performance metrics to capture
performance_metrics = {
    "total_execution_time": "< 300 seconds for test dataset",
    "memory_peak_usage": "< 1GB for 400K record processing",
    "database_insertion_rate": "> 1000 records/second",
    "api_fetch_rate": "< 30 seconds for test date range"
}
```

**Error Scenario Testing:**
```python
# Test quarantine mechanism
invalid_test_data = [
    {"high_price": 100, "low_price": 150},  # High < Low violation
    {"price": -10},                         # Negative price
    {"ts_event": None},                     # Missing timestamp
]

# Verify quarantine handling
quarantine_files = glob.glob("dlq/databento_validation_*.json")
assert len(quarantine_files) > 0, "Quarantine files should be created for invalid data"
```

### **Integration with Existing Test Infrastructure**

**Leverage Existing Test Patterns:**
- **`tests/hist_api/` Framework:** Use existing Databento connectivity patterns for live API testing
- **Mock Testing:** Extend existing unit test mocks for integration test scenarios
- **Database Test Utilities:** Reuse Epic 1 database setup and teardown patterns

**Test Environment Configuration:**
```bash
# Set up test environment
export TIMESCALEDB_TEST_HOST=localhost
export TIMESCALEDB_TEST_PORT=5432
export TIMESCALEDB_TEST_DB=hist_data_test
export DATABENTO_API_KEY=test_key_value

# Run comprehensive test suite
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_databento_e2e_pipeline.py -v --tb=short
```

### **Success Criteria and Validation Framework**

**Pipeline Success Indicators:**
1. **Zero unhandled exceptions** during CLI execution
2. **All expected record counts** present in TimescaleDB tables
3. **Clean log output** with no ERROR level entries for valid data
4. **Idempotency verified** through multiple execution runs
5. **Quarantine system functional** for invalid data scenarios
6. **Performance benchmarks met** for test data volumes

**Epic 2 Completion Validation:**
- All 5 Databento schemas (OHLCV, Trades, TBBO, Statistics, Definition) successfully ingested
- End-to-end data flow validated from API → Transformation → Validation → Storage
- CLI interface fully functional for all ingestion scenarios
- Error handling and quarantine mechanisms proven effective
- TimescaleLoader compatibility confirmed across all data types
- Complete logging and monitoring infrastructure operational

This comprehensive testing validates Epic 2's core objective: **"Implement the complete data ingestion pipeline (extraction, basic transformation, validation, storage) for the Databento API"** with full end-to-end verification of all components working together seamlessly.
