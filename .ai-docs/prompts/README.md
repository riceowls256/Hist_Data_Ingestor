- **03_COURSE_CORRECTION.md** - Handle requirement changes mid-implementation
- **04_BLOCKED_ESCALATION.md** - Escalate when AI is blocked

### üß™ Quality Assurance
- **05_TESTING_VALIDATION.md** - Ensure comprehensive testing before completion
- **08_DEBUG_INVESTIGATION.md** - Systematic debugging and issue investigation
- **09_PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md** - Optimize performance issues
- **10_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md** - Conduct thorough code reviews

### üèÅ Completion

## How to Use These Prompts

1. **Choose the appropriate prompt** based on your current need
2. **Copy the prompt template** and fill in the placeholders marked with [BRACKETS]
3. **Provide specific context** - the more specific, the better the AI response
4. **Include any relevant code, errors, or requirements** in your prompt
5. **Reference the .aidocs templates** to ensure AI follows standards

## Prompt Customization

Feel free to:
- Modify prompts for your specific needs
- Combine multiple prompts for complex scenarios  
- Add new prompts as you discover new patterns

```

### During Development
```
1. Daily STATUS_CHECK to track progress
2. BLOCKED_ESCALATION when stuck
